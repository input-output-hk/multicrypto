## Branches

Two main branches will be maintained: `develop` and `master`. `master` contains the latest version of the code that was tested end-to-end. `develop` contains the latest version of the code that runs all the tests (unit and integration tests). Integration tests don't test all the integrations. Hence, any version in `develop` might have bugs when deployed for an end-to-end test.
